# Queue-using-Stack
Implementation of Queue using Stack.

# Implementation
The operations that can be performed on the Queues (First-In-First-Out) such as push, pop, peek and contains are performed without the use of built-in functions and with the working method of Stacks (Lats-In-First-Out).  ie., The elements are inserted and deleted from the stack using the queue order (FIFO).
